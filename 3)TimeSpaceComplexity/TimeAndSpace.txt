# Time and Space Complexity
# Big O is just a way to represent the Time Complexity of an Algorithm
# TC: It is used to measure the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of speed as the input size grows
# SC: How much extra space your algorithm is using
# How to calculate Big O 
#   => Calculate total number of iterations
#   => Neglect lower order terms 
#   => Ignore constant coeffecients
