# Time and Space Complexity
# The algorithm which has low TC means that it has better Speed.
# Low Time Complexity => Better Speed 
# Binary Search >>>> Linear Search
# Big O is just a way to represent the Time Complexity of an Algorithm
# TC: It is used to measure the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of speed as the input size grows
# SC: How much extra space your algorithm is using
# How to calculate Big O 
#   => Calculate total number of iterations
#   => Neglect lower order terms 
#   => Ignore constant coeffecients
