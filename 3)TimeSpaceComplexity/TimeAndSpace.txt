# Time and Space Complexity
# The algorithm which has low Time Complexity, that means it has better speed
# Time Complexity is not equal to Time taken by the Algorithm
# Time Complexity is the best way to measure the efficiency of an Algorithm
# Time taken is not the right way to define the efficiency of an Algorithm
# Low Time Complexity => Better Speed 
# Binary Search >>>> Linear Search
# Big O is just a way to represent the worst case Time Complexity of an Algorithm
# Notation is nothing but a symbol
# Time Complexity: It is used to measure the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of speed as the input size grows
# Space Complexity: How much extra space your algorithm is using
# How to calculate Big O 
#   => Calculate total number of iterations
#   => Neglect lower order terms 
#   => Ignore constant coeffecients
