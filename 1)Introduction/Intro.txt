# Namaste DSA 
# Zero to Hero
# Basics to Advanced
# DSA will be a piece of cake for you if you follow this series
# Make your own notes
# Write your own code
# Spaced Repetition
# Solve Random Questions
# DSA is all about Approach, Solution, TC & SC 
# DSA is language Agnostic
# We can do DSA in any language
# DSA does not care in which language you solve the problem
# Interviewers don't care in which language you solve the problem
# Interviewers care about
#   => How you are approaching the problem 
#   => Can you develop the solution
#   => Can you optimise the solution
#   => Can you tell the Time and Space Complexity
#   => And then write the pseudocode
